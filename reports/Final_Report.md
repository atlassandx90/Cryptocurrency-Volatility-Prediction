---

## 2. Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering (volatility, moving averages, liquidity ratio)
3. Model Training using Random Forest
4. Evaluation with MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤
5. Deployment using Streamlit interface

## 3. Model Results

| Metric | Description | Value |
|:--------|:-------------|:-------|
| MAE | Mean Absolute Error | 0.035549 |
| RMSE | Root Mean Square Error | 0.142268 |
| R¬≤ | Coefficient of Determination | -7.5304 |
